# Kafka File Processing Demo

This project demonstrates how to process files concurrently in a distributed environment using Java Spring Boot, Docker Compose, and Kafka from Conduktor.

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Conduktor Kafka

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains the Java source code for the Spring Boot application.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file to set up Kafka and other necessary services.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kafka-file-processing-demo.git
   cd kafka-file-processing-demo
   ```

2. **Start the Docker containers:**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Build and run the Spring Boot application:**
   ```sh
   ./mvnw clean install
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

## Usage

1. **Call the api with the files which .**
2. The Spring Boot application will read the files, process them concurrently, and send the results to Kafka topics.
3. Monitor the Kafka topics using Conduktor.

## Configuration

- **Kafka Configuration:** Modify the `application.yml` file to configure Kafka brokers, topics, and other settings.
- **Docker Compose:** Update the `docker-compose.yml` file to change service configurations.
